# Project Outline
### by Neil Grogan - 13204052
I propose to create an Android Application for Death Notices. There is 
currently a gap in the Irish market for such an application. There are 
a few popular websites with such information:

* [RIP.ie][RIP]
* [Irish Times][]
* [Irish Independent][]

[RIP]: http://www.rip.ie
[Irish Times]: http://notices.irishtimes.com/?_fstatus=search;type=death
[Irish Independent]: http://www.announcement.ie/

But none of these have a way to browse the death notices on the go. 
This is a particular concern to my grandfather and my friends grandmother 
who have both browsed death notices on their iPads.

## Mobile Features
Just showing death notices would be too easy, so I plan to add filtering 
for them, by area and to view notices on a map. The reason for this is 
simple, usually people like to browse death notices for:

* areas they grew up in
* areas went to school in
* areas where they have lived/previously lived for years 

This could be in the form of alerts, with the first alert "free" and
 subsequent alerts could be paid for as an in-app purchase, for example.
 I would try to add sharing features for the notices.

## Market Research
A lot of the monetization strategies of the websites are either:
 
 * Charging per notice
 * Charging funeral directors
 * Tie in with florists and after-death services 

or a combination of the above. Since I won't have the scope to
achieve this within the deadlines, I plan to mock advertisments
 for services that could be supplied.

## Using Real Data

 I plan on using real data in the application. I plan to scrape a popular death
 notices website, and format this as JSON and have the application retrieve this
 data and process it. This will allow the application to be very realistic and 
 appealing to be possibly released commercially in a short timeframe.

## Challenges

The challenge with this application is keeping it simple to use and 
easy to navigate. The target audience is older people, so buttons should
 be bigger for example, to allow for reduced dexterity. Along with this
 the font should be nice, big and clear.

 Also easy sharing features are a must, as usually people like to let 
 others who may have known the deceased to be aware that the funeral is 
 in progress.
