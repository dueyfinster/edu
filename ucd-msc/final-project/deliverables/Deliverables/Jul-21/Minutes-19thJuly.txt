Minutes
we want to aim for business paper to be ‘finished’ end of next week
start on demo paper - talk to Kevin about how it should be done - lots of volunteers up for doing it
Garry up for doing demo paper but currently needs to focus on UI so probably doesn’t make sense right now
Garry will post by Tuesday with screenshots of preferences
Igor finishing user click - will be done today Sunday
LOS to tidy up some BE stuff for tomorrow - including adding get related tweets
UI - this Tuesday User Preferences popup to be done
UI - move on to home page for following Tuesday
User click - what the user sees when he clicks on Article - should see related tweets
Explanation from Igor on what we could show when click on Article
Suggestion that Garry get help from Igor if needed
Showing Article with tweets should be finished Friday week
Thinking that Kevin will finish Business Paper next week, suggestion by Neil to start Demo paper, LOS to review both, to discuss with Kevin
Goals this week - Garry on UI, Igor finishing click stuff, get both papers in hand and start User testing

Retrospective:
Garry: we need to support each other more and be aware of other people’s commitments
LOS: like the whole CI process, to improve - if people could give more time, more comm on slack, happy with the group, up and down about the project
Igor: lack of debugging poor, otherwise good, up and down as well
Neil: 30 credit module, people need to manage time around that, difficult to sync up, people should give feedback on each other’s work
