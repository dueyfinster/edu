      "I think this quote speaks volumes - &quot;WebAssembly has so far been a joint effort among Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and a few other folks.&quot;  Sometimes I think maybe, just maybe the W3C and other web standards groups finally have some wind behind their sails.<p>It may have taken a while, but with all these individuals and organizations cooperating in an open space, we may finally advance yet again into another new era of innovation for the web.<p>I am really excited about this, much like others in these comments.<p>We have been beating around the bush to have a true assembly&#x2F;development layer in the browser for a long time: Java applets, Flash, Silverlight, you name it - but no true standard that was open like Javascript is open. This component has the possibility of being the neutral ground that everyone can build on top of.<p>To the creators (Brendan Eich et. al) &amp; supporters, well done and best of luck in this endeavor.  It&#x27;s already started on the right foot (asm.js was what lead the way to this I think) - let&#x27;s hope they can keep it cooperative and open as much as possible for the benefit of everyone!\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been on one side of the perpetual (and tiresome) PNaCl-versus-asm.js debate, I&#x27;m thrilled to see a resolution. I really think this is a strategy that combines the best of both worlds. The crucial aspect is that this is polyfillable via JIT compilation to asm.js, so it&#x27;s still just JavaScript, but it has plenty of room for extensibility to support threads, SIMD, and so forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is enormous news. I could see a scenario where, in ~5 years, WebAssembly could provide an alternative to having to develop apps with HTML for the web, Swift for iOS, and Java for Android. Instead, you could build browser-based apps that actually delivered native performance, even for CPU- and GPU-intensive tasks.<p>Of course, there would still be UI differences required between the 3 platforms, but you would no longer need 3 separate development teams.\n"
