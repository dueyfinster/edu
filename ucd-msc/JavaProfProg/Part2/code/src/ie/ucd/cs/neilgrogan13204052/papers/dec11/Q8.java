     * Which of the following is true about file handling in Java? (Choose all that apply)
     *
     * A. When you construct an instance of File, if you do not use the file-naming semantics of your
          machine, the constructor will throw an IOException.
     * B. When you construct an instance of File, if the corresponding file does not exist on your file
          system, one will be created.
     * C. When an instance of File is garbage collected, the corresponding file on the local file system
          is deleted.
     * D. None of the above.
