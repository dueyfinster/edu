If I was using the factory pattern to help someone design additions to their house, 
I would have them input a list of colours and give them colours that match back.

In Java it would be a string list:
String colours = "blue orange mango";
which would then be tokenised and matched to output colours by factory:
You should choose: Purple, Red and Cyan.
